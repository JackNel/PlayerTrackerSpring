# PlayerTrackerSpring

Basic CRUD app to store a list of your favorite NFL players.  The purpose of this application is to practice
with Spring MVC.

####Functionality:
Create, edit, delete, and view a list of NFL players.
Search via name (or partial name), team, or position.

####Possible future functionality:
I would like to make this more of a player statistics site.

It would be great to integrate an NFL stats API, main issue is most of the live stats APIs cost aprrox. $600 and up/month.
A more realistic option would be to find a free CSV that I could update every few months.

Add more to CSS and implement some javascript.

Convert from mustache template to actual HTML.
